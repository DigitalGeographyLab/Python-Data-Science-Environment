# Python-Data-Science-Environment

The purpose of this page is to help you to install Python and different Python packages into your own computer / server.

## Anaconda Python distribution package

Even though it is possible to install Python from their homepage, we highly recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) which is an open source distribution of the Python programming language for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. In short, it makes life much easier when installing new tools to your Python.

### Installing Mini-conda

The basic Anaconda distribution package comes with [large number of different packages](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs). **However, in some cases you don't want to install those but to specify yourself exactly what packages should be installed.**

For this purpose, there is a [**mini-conda** package distribution](https://conda.io/docs/glossary.html#miniconda-glossary) available that basically comes with only Python interpreter and the conda package manager that can be used to install Python packages easily.
